Hi
My name is Kim, I am working to be able to work from home. I do crafts, an avid video gamer, and I love a good challenge. I am currently working to make a better portfolio for myself and to figure out how to get into the Data Entry and Data Analytics. I know enough HTML, Python, and Java script to get myself into trouble. I am trying to improve them to an actual skill I can use.

Tools/Languages: Spreadsheets, SQL, Tableau, R (RStudio) 
Data Management: Data Collection, Data Cleaning, Data Structures, Data Analysis, Data Visualization, Data Ethics
Software Platforms: Microsoft 365 Suite, Google Workspace, Slack, Zoom, Kaggle, Loom
Strengths: Problem-Solving, Collaboration, Attention to Detail, Project Management, Hard Worker, Empathetic, Caring
